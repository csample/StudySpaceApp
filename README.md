==========

The files uploaded are those from my web server under my Symfony project directory.
These folders contatin the configuration for my project.

Under the "app" directory we have multiple files but one to focus on here is the AppKernel.php file that holds the information of the web compnents used.
Additionallin in this directory, you will find the configuration files for my framework where we have the routing.yml , config.yml , security.yml , and parameters.yml

Under the "src" directory we have our controller files that handle the requests for my Entities.
  In the "Entity" folder you will find the files that obtain the information that will be used "get/set" functions.
  Additionally, in the "Repositorty" folder you will find the files that are generated by the Doctirne ORM
  
Under the "web" directory you will find additional config files like "app_dev.php" that will setup the permissions.

Some other files that I have up loaded are:
  The local HTML file used to generate the Google Maps API and loads the requested info via JQuery
  The second file is a .csv file that was used to populate my database with the locations of the buildings and services on   campus that is referenced on the map itself.
